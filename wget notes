*wget with wait command, we used shell .sh sleep command instead for the time being -O is the abbrev. of --output-document hard pipe option;
wget -w 3 -i filenamehere
--output-document=

*wget shell script implement w/o sleep timer, hard pipes into file1.pdf, etc. to avoid missing extension issues;
wget -O file1.pdf https://emdinspections.saccounty.net/document.aspx?id={DD878831-3A38-47CB-A3AE-C8F1BE20A0BD}&type=application/pdf
wget -O file2.pdf https://emdinspections.saccounty.net/document.aspx?id={04920555-CFD2-4B8F-A12B-678F02224E33}&type=application/pdf

*loop pdftotext on every file, output into filename itself + .txt extension;
for file in *.pdf; do pdftotext "$file" "$file.txt"; done

*modified version to work with our file since the above line was doing xyz.pdf.txt instead of just xyz.txt;
for file in *.pdf; do pdftotext "$file"; done

*the below line uses regular expressions to key in on lines starting with hashtag/pound sign, which are the violations;
*prelim to using grep on every single text file and pipe + appending for a master list of violations, building up to .csv file;
grep -n '#' FA0001004.txt

potentials (YES, TESTED AND THEY WORK!)

-H to add filenames
>> to redirect (append)



now, modify to loop all texts, no .sh needed

for file in *.txt; do grep -nH '#' "$file" >> test.txt; done

"grep -nH '#' FA0001006.txt >> test.txt”
