Ambient room temperature near the make line was at 70 F. One small plastic bag with ice was found under the insert. Cover inserts with lids when not in use and do not overfill inserts. When using ice to cold hold, do not simply put the food item(s) on top of the ice. Make sure the level of the ice around the food container is at least the same as that of the food item.
- The right side refrigeration unit at the make line was out of order. Operator stated that they are waiting for parts due to arrive later this week.

Two smaller inserts were used to store tomatoes on the inoperable make line refrigeration unit. More ice was applied under and around the inserts which were covered with lids when not in use. Employees were told not to overfill inserts.
Minor Violations a. Top layers of ham, turkey, mortadela in open inserts on left side make line cold top were found slightly out of temperature at 44 to 46 F using a thermocouple.

b. Potentially hazardous food items (steak, ham, mortadela, turkey, shredded cheese) inside the walk-in refrigerator were measured at 44 to 46 F using a thermocouple. Ambient air temperature inside the walk-in refrigerator (near the door) after leaving the door closed for several minutes was measured at 45 F.
