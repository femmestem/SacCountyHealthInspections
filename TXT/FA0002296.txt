# 14b WAREWASHING AND SANITIZING PROCEDURES
OBSERVATIONS: The dishwasher was in use during inspection. Facility had thermolabels that indicated that hot rinse sanitizing was working at 11:30 a.m. At about 1:50 pm, on first run, holding thermometer maximum temp was 148 deg. F. Thermolabels and second run showed that labels did NOT change color to 160 deg. F and thermometer read 140 deg. F. Third run showed thermolabels changed to required 160 deg. at the plate, however thermometer read only 148 deg. F. During this time the maximum temperature that the thermometer ont he dishwasher read was 144 deg. F.
Ensure that dishes and wares are properly sanitized at all times, reaching 160 deg. F at the plate. Recommend that you do not allow the dishwasher to stop due to dishes finishing the run - remove trays of dishes as they finish and allow them to drain off the drain board, so that the dish washer does not turn off intermittently.
Corrected at the time of inspection.
The thermometer may not be working on the dishwasher.
