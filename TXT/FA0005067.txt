OBSERVATIONS: Shredded cheese and guacamole in inserts on walk up (west) side make line were measured at 48 F and 44 F, respectively. These items were situated on the side closest to the hot held food items. They were moved on the far (right) side of the unit during the inspection. Check food temperatures regularly and ensure that all parts of these food items are at 41 F or below at all times.
- Repeat Violation -
CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation.
