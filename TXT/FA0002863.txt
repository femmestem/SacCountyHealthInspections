NOTES
NOTE:
Paper towel dispenser and soap dispenser installed at the three compartment sink is installed directly above the sanitizing compartment. Relocate both dispensers to the opposite end to avoid potential cross contamination. Per operator, washing from left to right is more convenient so dispensers will be relocated.
No violation was cited due to no clean dishes air drying/present at the three compartment sink during time of inspection. Employee personal drinks were stored directly above the sanitizing compartment where clean dishes air dry. Relocate employee personal drink/food storage away from clean utensils and all food preparation areas.
