NO VIOLATIONS AT THE TIME OF INSPECTION. THANK-YOU!

Note: Mop sink uses a "Y connection" to send water to chemical feeds. The Y connection has shut off switches below the anti-siphon device, which will UNDETECTABLY degrade the faucet anti-siphon device over time. However most chemical feeds have an anti-siphon/back flow prevention device. What this means: Should you ever remove the chemical feeds and keep a hose at the mop sink, the anti-siphon device on the faucet may not protect the potable water supply. See handout for further information.
