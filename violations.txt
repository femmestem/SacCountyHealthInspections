OBSERVATIONS: Operator did not demonstrate acceptable food safety knowledge on proper warewashing. Observed hose with sprayer attached to handwash sink at donut prep area. Also, found multi-use utensils stored on drain board of this sink. Per operator, they have hose attached to this sink because utensils and some other food equipment is washed at this sink. Cease practice immediately. Handwashing sink shall be used only to wash hands. Use 2-comp warewash sink in the back area to wash, rinse, sanitize and air dry all utensils and food contact equipment (pans, bowls, etc.).
