OBSERVATIONS: MAJOR VIOLATION
Turkey quarter in shallow pan on the steam table was measured at 117 to 120 F. Operator stated that this was put on the steam table from hot holding less than two hours before. instead of reheating to 165 F, operator had the turkey rapidly cooled (wrapped in plastic and put in ice water). Options for hot holding compliance were discussed with the operator, including the use of time as a public health control.
Minor Violations a. Potentially hazardous food (PHF) items inside and in inserts on the sandwich prep cold top, including but not limited to tuna salad, burger patties, shredded cheese and turkey slices, were temped at 44 to 48 F. Ambient temperature inside the unit was at 40 F. Thermostat was adjusted and ambient temperature was at 37 F at end of inspection.
b. PHFs near the door inside the walk-in refrigerator were measured at 43 to 45 F. Lower thermostat within 24 hours to enable unit to keep all contents at 41F or below.
c. Tri tip, pulled pork and bbq pork inside the two door glass front refrigerator were temped at 46 to 49 F. Ambient temperature inside the unit was at 47 F. Thermostat was adjusted but did not change the inside ambient temperature. PHFs inside the unit were moved into functioning refrigerated units. Have the unit serviced or repaired within 2 days. Do not store potentially hazardous foods in it until it is capable of keeping contents at 41F or below.
Note: Approved procedures for keeping cold PHFs at 41 F or below were discussed with the operator. Handout on holding temperatures for safe food handling was provided.
CODE DESCRIPTION: Potentially hazardous foods shall be maintained at or below 41F or at or above 135F. The following foods may be held at or below 45F: raw shell eggs, unshucked live molluscan shellfish, pasteurized milk and pasteurized milk products in original sealed containers, potentially hazardous foods held during transportation.
