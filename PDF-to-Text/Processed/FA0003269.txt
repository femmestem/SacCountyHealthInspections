F then cool to 41 deg. F within an additional 4 hours. Leaving food in a warm room will not adequately or quickly cool foods.

Recommend breaking into smaller pots/storage containers (more surface area will cool quicker) or using a cooling paddle or adding ice after cooking, or other quick chill methods. See handout. Correct immediately.
